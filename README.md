# EE2211-Helper-Functions
This repository contains resources for the NUS module, Introduction to Machine Learning, EE2211. I found the content in this module essential as I learned more about the fundamental concepts in machine learning.

# Foundations of Machine Learning:
- Introduction to basic concepts, terminology, and principles of machine learning
- Understanding the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning
- Supervised Learning: Study of algorithms used for supervised learning tasks, Regression: Predicting numerical values, Classification: Categorizing data into     predefined classes
- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering: Grouping data points based on similarities, Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques for simplifying and visualizing complex      data

# Evaluation Metrics:
- Understanding how to evaluate the performance of machine learning models
- Metrics like accuracy, precision and recall

# Model Selection
- Preprocessing and transforming data to improve model performance
- Dealing with missing data and outliers
- Exploring different machine learning models and their applicability
- Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning

# Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning:
- Basics of artificial neural networks and deep learning concepts
